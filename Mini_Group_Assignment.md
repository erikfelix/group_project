## Roles

Our roles will be divided by tasks. Erik is our Geospatial Data Manager and he will be responsible for map design, code troubleshooting, and most importantly, crisis management. 

Kevin is our Geospatial Data Analyst, and he will be responsible for research design, coding functions and figures to interpret spatial ACS data, and morale boosting.

We will further be dividing the work by working in stations. Given that our research question revolves around L Line stations, we will be each taking half of the stations for data prep and analysis.

## Status Update

We have considered other alternative approaches to the project, but feel strongly about our research design and hypothesis. Our big picture questions involve gauging the breadth of work we want to take on for the project (how many stations? Do we break it down by country of origin?).

We have also thought of some possible deliverables:

For each station:  
-Total immigrant population in a 5-mile radius in 2010  
-Total immigrant population in a 5-mile radius 2019  
-Percentage change in a 5-mile radius  
For the City of Los Angeles  
-Percentage change of immigrant population between 2010 and 2019  

For the the station with the highest change in immigrant population:  
-A side-by-side map that uses  the Year of Entry variable  to show the number of  immigrant populations that entered between 2000-2010 (using 2010 ACS), and the number of  immigrant populations that entered between 2010-2019 (using 2019 ACS)  

For the one station with slowest growth in immigrant population:   
-Two phased map that covers the Year of Entry data for immigrant populations that entered between 2000-2010 (using 2010 ACS), and the Year of Entry data for immigrant populations that entered between 2010-2019 (using 2019 ACS). 

## Data Update

We are pivoting away from the DP02 Table we initially proposed, and will be using the Table B05015 .geojson data (ACS 5-year, Place of Birth by Year of Entry for the Foreign-born Population). We felt that this data better fit our needs and research question. The original ACS table we were using was a CSV and did not contain spatial data. The new ACS .geojson file also includes the Year of Entry variable which offers another datapoint to the immigrant trends of our geographic area of study. 

We still need a set of data concerning the general trends of immigrant population in the City of LA so that we can compare growth rates in station areas to the broader average trend.

## Concerns

Perhaps this is a fault of ours in navigating the Census Reporter website, but we weren’t immediately able to find the other years of the ACS for Table B05015 (we are attending office hours to sort this out).

We have yet to find a City of LA dataset that is conducive to the map we’d like to produce. The dataset that we find would have to also be looking at year of entry, or at the very least a comparable immigration marker.

Most of all, we are concerned about the tedious and time consuming process that it will take to produce three maps for six-plus stations.
