# Next Stop: Rail-induced Displacement of Immigrant Communities? 

## Research Question

Los Angeles County is home to millions of immigrants from all over the world. With housing in LA becoming increasingly unaffordable, 
working class immigrant communities are particularly at risk of displacement. With Measure R’s passage in 2008, and Measure M’s passage in 2016, 
the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro) has been heavily investing in light rail. Metro’s L (formerly Gold) Line is a 
prime example of the increasing investment in light rail. Cross cutting through both immigrant communities and wealthy white communities, the L Line 
traverses a particularly diverse segment of Los Angeles County making it a prime candidate for study. <br>
<br>
As the gentrification of historically working class LA communities continues, more immigrant households are at risk of displacement. 
Did Metro’s construction of the L Line through Pasadena, and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Highland Park, Lincoln Heights, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, 
Boyle Heights, and East Los Angeles have a measurable impact on exacerbating displacement of foreign-born households? Or do we see similar trends among 
foreign-born households when compared to Los Angeles County?

## Why It Matters? What's at Stake?

If we see evidence of the L Line construction having a measurable impact on the displacement of foreign-born households, then we are looking at a 
transportation equity issue. In the context of this study, we define transportation equity as an even distribution of costs and benefits across a 
community impacted by transit. If communities that historically depend on transit the most are being displaced, then they are bearing the brunt of 
the costs without being able to enjoy the benefits. 

## Spatial Scope

Our spatial scope consists of Los Angeles County neighborhoods along the Metro L Line, specifically Pasadena, Highland Park, Lincoln Heights, 
Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and East LA. These neighborhoods represent a broad spectrum of Los Angeles County demographics, from the 
mostly, middle class suburbs of Pasadena to the gentrifying, Latinx and Asian neighborhoods of Highland Park and Chinatown, and finally the 
bulwark working-class Latinx neighborhoods of Boyle Heights and East LA. The light rail was installed in phases, with the Pasadena to Union Station 
segment installed in 2003, and the Union Station to East LA segment installed in 2009. Because of this, it is impossible to use a cohesive timeframe 
that fully captures the effect the light rail had on the size of the immigrant populations of these communities before and after installation. 
Still, population shifts do not happen overnight; they occur gradually over time. Thus, we use the temporal benchmarks of 2010 and 2019 to measure whether 
there is a difference in the size of immigrant populations along the L Line in our designated neighborhoods.The year 2010 gives us a reference point that 
captures all our neighborhoods once the light rail has fully been operational. The year 2019 gives us a large enough window to allow whatever neighborhood 
changes the light rail may spur to occur. 

## Description of Data Sources

The data sources that will be used for our project are [LA Metro Rail GIS Data](https://developer.metro.net/gis-data/) and <b>foreign-born</b> data from 
the 2010 and 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates. The LA Metro Rail GIS Data provides shapefiles for the L Line by station. It was
last updated in March 2016. [The ACS 5-year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2010/5-year.html)
are based on household surveys that are conducted on an ongoing basis. The 5-year Estimates are based on the data acquired over the prior five years of 
the publication date, providing a large and reliable size to estimate the current standing of a given demographic by tract. 

## Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations

Using our scope of the aforementioned LA neighborhoods, we aim to utilize geometry data of L Line Stations from the LA Metro Rail GIS dataset as a base 
layer and overlaying data from the ACS 5-year Estimates regarding foreign-born households by census tract. We will be looking at a 0.5 mile radius 
from each station, and counting foreign-born households in census tracts that fall within that radius. <br>
<br>
We will track the difference in populations from the 2010 and 2019 ACS data and compare that difference to the overall average across LA County. We will also draw comparisons between data around stations 
in gentrifying neighborhoods (Boyle Heights, Chinatown, Highland Park, etc.) versus stations in higher income whiter neighborhoods (Mount Washington, 
Pasadena, etc.). 

## Expected Insights

By overlaying the size of the immigrant population in the identified neighborhoods along the L Line in 2010 and 2019, we expect to have a better 
understanding of what kind of effect major capital public investments like light rail has on communities, specifically, immigrant households in 
underserved neighborhoods. The neighborhoods of Pasadena, Chinatown and East LA have varying demographics with the common through line of the L Line. 
Comparing potential adverse effects, and their magnitude, that a flood of public investment can have on immigrant communities can help planners and 
elected officials make more tailored decisions when bringing long overdue services to their doorsteps.
